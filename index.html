  <h1>My Accomplishments Throughout my Life</h1>
  <img scr="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-o3ns39q2m3/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/508/896/ms307__28884.1491677388.jpg?c=2" width="200"/>
  
  <p>Throught my whole life, the one accomplishment I'm most proud of is learning to speak English.
    I grew up with Spanish as my first language, when I started pre-k, I struggled to understant my teachers and classmates. 
    Back during my Elementry school years we still did reading level, challenging your reading skills.
    By the end of kindergarten, I had only learned  up to letter E and could only count to 13. 
    That Summer is when my mother decided to sign me up to a summer school program to help me with my English.
  When I attended this summer school program, they did many activites to help us learn English faster and have fun at the same time.
  A few examples, we would create our own stories and tell them to the class, or practice speaking English with our classmates. </p>
  
  <h2> After The Summer School Program</h2>
  <p1> I ended summer camp with being in 4th place for being one of the top five students to have make so much progress,
    I had little knowledge of speaking, reading, and writing in English but I could almost fluently speak it.
    When I entered 2nd grade I was able to help other students like me, only knowing Spanish and teaching them more on the language.
    I hope there are still programs like this or even tuturing to help kids who are bilingual.
